## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/coderthroughout/AI-Powered-Multi-Task-Application.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/coderthroughout/AI-Powered-Multi-Task-Application.git)
    cd AI-Powered-Multi-Task-Application
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API keys and environment variables:**

    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    -   Add necessary API keys and environment variables (e.g., LLM API keys, database credentials).
    -   Example `.env` file:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Interact with the application:**

    -   Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the application.
    -   Use natural language commands to perform various tasks.
    -   Explore the available modules and functionalities.

3.  **Example Usage:**

    -   To generate a summary of a text document:
        ```bash
        python main.py --task summarize --input "path/to/document.txt"
        ```
    -   To translate text from English to French:
        ```bash
        python main.py --task translate --input "Hello, world!" --language french
        ```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance. Key components include:

-   **Core Module:** Manages the overall application flow and task execution.
-   **Task Modules:** Implement specific functionalities (e.g., summarization, translation, data analysis).
-   **LLM Integration Layer:** Handles communication with Large Language Models.
-   **Data Processing Layer:** Processes and manipulates data from various sources.
-   **API Integration Layer:** Integrates with external APIs for enhanced functionality.
-   **User Interface:** Provides an interface for user interaction.
